Cloning starter project #
To initialize the development environment, clone our dedicated Rust template:
$ git clone https://github.com/polyphene/kythera-rs-starter.git Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the project layout looks like:
$ cd kythera-rs-starter $ tree . -d -L 1 . ├── actors ├── build-helper └── tests 3 directories Each folder has its own use:</description></item><item><title>Create an actor</title><link>https://polyphene.github.io/kythera/docs/tutorials/rust/actor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://polyphene.github.io/kythera/docs/tutorials/rust/actor/</guid><description>As we previously mentioned, all of our native actors will have to be created in the actors folder.
An actor takes the shape of a Rust crate. In the starter you cloned you should already be able to find one crate, hello-world.
Configuring the actor crate #
To proceed, we can use the script at the root of the repository to create a new actor and its test:
$ ./create-actor.sh basic-actor $ cd actors/basic-actor/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ls -la total 36 .</description></item><item><title>Test our actor</title><link>https://polyphene.github.io/kythera/docs/tutorials/rust/test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://polyphene.github.io/kythera/docs/tutorials/rust/test/</guid><description>In this final step of our basic Rust tutorial we will go over the creation of tests for our basic-actor.
Configuring the test actor crate #
If we move to the tests folder from the root of the repository, we can see that a basic-actor-test has been created.
This is the crate that we will use to write test for our basic-actor.
Test Actor&amp;rsquo;s development #
To demonstrate the capabilities of Kythera we will create two tests: TestAdd() and TestFailAddArgumentType().</description></item></channel></rss>
